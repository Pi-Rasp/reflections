When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When I am sure that I want to publish my code and also sure that its working.
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Pulling changes manually will allow me when exactly I want to update my local repository with the working code.
	It helps as always syncing with GitHub can cause some problems.
