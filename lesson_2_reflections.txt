What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Initializing a repository will add a .git directory. This will make sure that this normal
	direcctory has converted into a Git Repository.
	This is needed because now I am able to control different versions of a file using Git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	Staging area is something like a space in which currently I'm working on.
	It's not commited yet but soon it will be. Its a great space to use for differentiating what is commited, what 
	presently I'm working on etc.
