What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Initializing a repository will add a .git directory. This will make sure that this normal
	direcctory has converted into a Git Repository.
	This is needed because now I am able to control different versions of a file using Git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	Staging area is something like a space in which currently I'm working on.
	It's not commited yet but soon it will be. Its a great space to use for differentiating what is commited, what 
	presently I'm working on etc.
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	Staging area allows me to make a change and commit after a logical change.
	
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	Branches would be helpful when I need to add some experimental features but dont want to change the original 
	master branch. So its really needed to keep track of new version and original version.
	
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	With the help of diagrams all commits of a branch can be seen as a graph and its easy to understand the commits.
	
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

	Mergning two branches together will help adding the extra work to the master branch.
	
What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

	I'm full of confusion now.
